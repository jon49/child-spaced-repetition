An application for working with young children which need to memorize large amounts of information, including children with speech impediments. This application uses SuperMemo’s spaced repetition algorithm to enable higher retention rates of large amounts of information. Space repetition is similar to flash cards but spaces out the amount that you see a specific card based on the user’s ability to recall the information.
